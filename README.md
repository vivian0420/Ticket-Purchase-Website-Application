Ticket Purchase Web Application
===========================================

## Overview
In this project, I developed a ticket purchase website(like EventBrite!) that offers a range of features. Users can create event listings, purchase event tickets, transfer tickets, and view their purchase history. The technology stack used includes Jetty as the web server, HTML, CSS, Javacript for the front-end, Java for the back-end, and MySQL as the database. Additionally, I integrated Google account login into the application to improve both user experience and security.

## Main Features
1. Login with ... and logout: Authenticate users to use the website through Google account. Provide a signout option and maintain user state appropriately.
2. User account: Allow a user to view and update personal user account information (e.g., name).
3. View user transactions: Display details for all events for which the user has purchased tickets.
4. View events: Display a list of all events.
5. View event: Display details for a specific event.
6. Create event: Allow the user to create a new event by entering all appropriate detail.
7. Modify/delete event: Allow a user to modify or delete an event that s/he has created.
8. Purchase tickets: Allow the user to purchase tickets for an event.
9. Transfer tickets: Allow the user to transfer tickets to another user.
10. Upload and display images: Integrate images into the wedsite, allow a user to upload images when creating an event and display when the event is viewed.
